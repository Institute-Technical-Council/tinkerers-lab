					<p>The Institute Technical Council (ITC) provides a unique platform for the freshmen of the institute to transform their ideas into technical projects through Institute Technical Summer Projects (ITSP).

Started in 2012, each year it gives the freshmen first hand experience of working on a technical project under the mentorship of their seniors. Also, in the beginning of ITSP, STAB (now known as ITC) conducts a technical Boot camp where it conducts sessions based on various topics like Arduino, AVR, motors, sensors, image processing to equip the students with the required knowledge.

Every year ITSP has been a huge success among freshmen and some really interesting projects have come out through this initiative. This serves as major boost to increasing the participation and enthusiasm of students in technical activities.

The Institute reimburses the cost of expensive electronic and mechanical components that are required to build the project. We see many enthusiastic students working for days together in Tinkerers' Lab and/or from their rooms while frequently visiting local hardware stores and electronics shops in Lamington Road thereby gaining valuable hands-on experience in this high technology area.

Some of the Good projects made under ITSP are shown below:</p>

						<h2>Emo TV</h2>
							<a href="proj1.html"><img src="images/space-station.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<div>
								<p>As the name suggests, EmoTv is capable of interacting with a person and determine his current mood.

Running on python coded lines, it can efficiently involve in a conversation with a subject. Our TV fea-
tures playing songs alongside the emotion recognition part. As an added bonus, it shows up a cartoonized

image of yours with your name written on bottom right of screen and displays your emotion. We have
also added image magick gui alongside the cartoonized image for further editing of the image. The entire

project is completely based on python scripts, displaying the vastness of the language. Our project cov-
ers topics ranging from machine learning using Tensorflow to Speech recognition and conversion. Our

EmoTV Project is a step towards making robots understand human emotion, thus lessening the gap of human machine interaction.</p>

						<h2>H.A.N.C.O.</h2>
							<a href="proj1.html"><img src="images/space-station.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<div>
								<p>H.A.N.C.O. is an IoT device developed with a vision to become a dedicated personal AI assistant. The H.A.N.C.O. headgear is equipped with a camera and a SBC. It’s supported by our companion app called ‘The Backend’. The device is capable of delivering multiple AI functionalities. The device has professional level OCR built in and text-to-speech support that enables the blind to read the way like normal people do. Also the device has image recognition and classification capabilities. H.A.N.C.O. helps you analyze the surroundings and gives you suggestions based on the things you see. Currently H.A.N.C.O. supports logo recognition, gender classification, flower classification and animal classification.

						<h2>Scribble</h2>
							<a href="proj1.html"><img src="images/space-station.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<div>
								<p>Making a device ("smart pen") which will enable us to convert handwritten
scripts into editable text format in real time. The writer should get a soft copy
of whatever he/she writes on the paper in the form of a text document without
the requirement of scanning the paper.</p>

						<h2>optika</h2>
							<a href="proj1.html"><img src="images/space-station.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<div>
								<p>The project Optika aims to make surrounding of a visually impaired person more friendly by installing a lot of very helpful features on a raspberry pi. The device works on voice commands and a push button. Although it is a prototype, we have tried to make it as user-friendly as possible and we have enabled features which we thought are reasonable and removed the rest. We just need to power it and it will automatically connect to the mobile wifi( or predefined wifi) and successfully performs many features.</p>
