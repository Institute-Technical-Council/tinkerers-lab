<h1>NASA’S NEW HORIZON MISSION</h1>
<p><b>Title :</b> NASA’s New Horizon Mission</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Henry Throop, Senior Scientist, Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona, USA</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> March 13th, 2016</p>

 

<p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p>NASA’s New Horizons mission, from its development and construction, through launch in 2006, to its successful encounter with Pluto, and plans for onward encounters with bodies in the distant Kuiper Belt.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT THE TALK</b></p>
<p>A talk on NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto and Beyond was organized by the Students’ Technical Activities Body (STAB) on 13th March 2016. The talk was presented by Planetary Scientist, Dr. Henry Throop from Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, USA. Dr. Henry Throop spoke of this NASA spacecraft mission, from its development and construction, through its launch in 2006, to its successful encounter with Pluto and the Kuiper belt. He talked about how the team resolved last moment connectivity issues with ease and explained the importance of the various calculations and precautions that need to be taken care of when someone launches a satellite. The audience later asked questions to which Dr. Throop answered with a lot of enthusiasm. He also had personal discussions with students about their work and made several suggestions. He later paid a visit to Tinkerers’ Lab where he was briefed about the idea behind the lab by the STAB Overall Coordinator. Dr. Throop also joined students at the Astro GC and looked at celestial bodies explaining the science of the night sky to the enthusiastic crowd.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT THE SPEAKER</b></p>
<p>Dr. Throop is a Senior Scientist with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, USA. He received his PhD in Planetary Science from the University of Colorado, USA, in 2000. He is involved with the New Horizons’ mission to Pluto, working with the visibleIR spectrometer (Ralph) team. Dr. Throop has been a member of the science team for NASA’s New Horizons mission since 2003, and was involved in its historic flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. He has published over 40 articles in scientific journals, and has studied many aspects of the outer solar system, on topics ranging from the rings of Saturn and Jupiter, planet and star formation, to astrobiology and the origins of life.
