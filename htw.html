<h1> HOW THINGS WORK</h1>

<p>How things work is low prep event in which tinkerers meet at a place and break open objects that are not working and understand the parts involved in making and working of these things. These are community driven events and are a huge success. Following are a few of these sessions held in the past:
</p>
<li>
Hard disk</li>
<li>Mouse and Keyboard</li>
<li>Printer</li>
<li>LCD TV</li>
<li>Motor</li>
<li>Accelerometer and Gyroscope- we used MPU6050 to figure out how accelerometer and gyroscope works through a small project.</li>
<li>Projector</li>
<li>3-D printer</li>
